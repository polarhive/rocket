A simple in browser, HTML5 player for videos hosted on the LBRY network
```

## How does it work?

Uses client side [libre](https://polarhive.ml/blog/free-libre-software) JavaScript to play videos. A wrapper for spee.ch

## Todo 🔨

- [ ] Build a homepage
- [ ] Add RSS support to check for channel subscriptions & video updates
- [ ] Build a WebExtension to help redirect
- [ ] Host it on Codeberg pages

### Goals ✨

- Static website
- Lightweight
- LibreJS compliant

### Anti-goals ⛔

- Make it a full fledged Odysee clone.
- Server side dynamic updates.
- Become non-free (proprietary).
- Support Audio/File/PDFs, (non-video) content.

## Rocket? 🚀

It's fast ~ Spaceman? Odysee? - Rocket duh!

## Is this [FastLBRY](https://www.notabug.org/jyamihud/FastLBRY-terminal)?

No.

It shares similar goals, & it might merge with FastLBRY one day, if needed. But currently I'm trying to make a clone of [Invidious](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious) or [Piped](https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped/) that works locally in a web-browser.

## Is this project affiliated with [LBRY](https://lbry.org), [FastLBRY](https://www.notabug.org/jyamihud/FastLBRY-terminal) or [Odysee](https://odysee.com)?

No.
