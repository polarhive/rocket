- [x] Host it on [Codeberg pages](https://polarhive.ml/rocket/)

### Goals âœ¨

- LibreJS compliant

### Anti-goals â›”

- Make it a full fledged Odysee clone.

## Rocket? ðŸš€

It's fast ~ Spaceman? Odysee? - Rocket duh!

## Is this [FastLBRY](https://www.notabug.org/jyamihud/FastLBRY-terminal)?

No.

It shares similar goals, & it might merge with FastLBRY one day, if needed. But currently I'm trying to make a clone of [Invidious](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious) or [Piped](https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped/) that works locally in a web-browser.

## Is this project affiliated with [LBRY](https://lbry.org), [FastLBRY](https://www.notabug.org/jyamihud/FastLBRY-terminal) or [Odysee](https://odysee.com)?

No.
